Analyze Heart Disease Pathogeny by Machine Learning

It is interesting that we find there is actually a close connection between heart disease and people's body conditions. Based on this finding, we could find patient's heart disease on time and give them a timely treatment before the heart disease occur.
The dataset of this problem contains over 1000 exampls with 14 features. The main Machine Learning method we use includes SVM, CART, Random Forest.
